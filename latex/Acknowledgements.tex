\label{chap:Acknowledgments}

I want to thank Prof. Dr. David Hausheer and Dr. Jonghoon Kwon for their intensive and very good support while supervising my thesis. The discussions with them and their suggestions were very helpful and improved the quality of the work. It was a productive and very enjoyable cooperation. Thanks to both of you!

Secondly, I want to say thank you to the SCIONLab team for their open minds and quick responses to questions. They also helped me with technical issues and solved them in cooperation with me. I hope that my work will help the SCIONLab team to accelerate the adoption of SCION in the world!

I've spent multiple month on this thesis, but never walked alone this road. I want to also say thank you to my friends in Magdeburg and Germany. They supported me in every possible way and without them I would not have the strength to do this report. They also proofread my thesis and provided me enormous feedback. Thanks to all of you!
