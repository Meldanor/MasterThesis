\addchap{Abstract}
The Internet in its current state does not provide the possibility to use multiple paths for the same communication nor does the end-host have control over the chosen path. SCION \cite{SCIONBook, SCIONPaper} does provide solutions but lacks of an efficient mechanism to monitor the networks traffic and identify an overuse of resources. This works provides a scalable solution for networks in general to do so based on a heuristic to place probes, called SpeedCams. The work does provide an implementation for SCION and its testbed SCIONLab and the evaluation was based on it. It shows that a hit rate of 80\% and better can be achieved with only few nodes such as 10\% of the network.
