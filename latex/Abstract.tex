\addchap{Abstract}
This thesis presents a heuristic based mechanism to efficiently monitor traffic inside a network especially for multi-path communication in SCION. The goal is to detect user overusing their resources such as bandwidth and cause congestion in the network. 

The requirements for the solution were a high detection rate with a low impact on the performance. Based on this, it should also be able to scale with hundreds of nodes. This was achieved by using a heuristic for the selection of probes and only using a partition of the network, 10\% or fewer.

A concept for networks in general was proposed and implemented in SCION. The evaluation for it was done in SCIONLab over the course of 48 hours. It was shown that the solution reached the goals.
