# SpeedCam: Efficient Detection of Multi-path Resource Overuse in SCIONLab SCIONLab

This is my master thesis with the title above. Thank you Andreas Reich for the [template](https://github.com/Wumpf/thesis_latex_template), you are awesome. I will leave the original readme.md content here, but modified header level and the license paragraph to avoid confusion.

## Topic
The SpeedCam is about identifing malicious user inside a network which is capable of multi-path communication.

The [implementation](https://github.com/Meldanor/SCIONLab_SpeedCam) of this thesis is written in Go and was used for the evaluation.

## Original README by Wumpf
This is what worked on my university (Magdeburg). You almost certainly need something like this, but it may very well look completely different.

#### Tools of my Choice
Back in the day I worked with [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) which I enjoyed using a lot.
To organize the [bibliography](latex/bibliography.bib) I used [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) which was a great help to get an overview and cleanup the references.

### Q & A

#### What is glsl.tex?
A language highlighting definition for glsl code blocks. Left it in there because I thought you might need it or at least could use an example for custom language definition.

#### Why \subfile and not XY?
\subfile has the amazing advantage that you can compile parts of the thesis interpedently. Once you get more images in this increases your improves time tremendously!
